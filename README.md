- The `app` module - contains app level and scaffolding classes that bind the rest of the codebase, such as MainActivity, `MovieAppNavigation` that controlls navigation using Naviagtion 3 library
- The `feature` module - feature specific modules which are scoped to handle a single responsibility in the app.
- The `core` module - common library modules containing auxiliary code shared between other modules in the app. It contains the following modules : `data`, `domain`, `network` and `model`
